    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a powerful model that allows you to analyze how a set of features affects some binary target label. Posterior distribution over the weights gives us an estimation of the influence of each particular feature on the probability of the target being equal to one. But most importantly, posterior distribution gives us the interval estimates for each weight of the model. This is very important for data analysis when you want to not only provide a good model but also estimate the uncertainty of your conclusions.\n",

    "\n",
    "If we have a binary random variable $y$ (which may indicate whether a person makes \\$50K) and if the probabilty of the positive outcome $p(y = 1)$ is for example 0.8, we will say that the *odds* are 4 to 1 (or just 4 for short), because succeding is 4 time more likely than failing $\\frac{p(y = 1)}{p(y = 0)} = \\frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's return to the effect of gender on the salary. Let's compute the **ratio** between the odds of a male having salary $\\geq $ \\$50K and the odds of a female (with the same level of education, experience and everything else) having salary $\\geq$ \\$50K. The first feature of each person in the dataset is the gender. Specifically, $x_{i1} = 0$ if the person is female and $x_{i1} = 1$ otherwise. Consider two people $i$ and $j$ having all but one features the same with the only difference in $x_{i1} \\neq x_{j1}$.\n",

    "So given the correct logistic regression model, we can estimate odds ratio for some feature (gender in this example) by just looking at the corresponding coefficient. But of course, even if all the logistic regression assumptions are met we cannot estimate the coefficient exactly from real-world data, it's just too noisy. So it would be really nice to build an interval estimate, which would tell us something along the lines \"with probability 0.95 the odds ratio is greater than 0.8 and less than 1.2, so we cannot conclude that there is any gender discrimination in the salaries\" (or vice versa, that \"with probability 0.95 the odds ratio is greater than 1.5 and less than 1.9 and the discrimination takes place because a male has at least 1.5 higher probability to get >$50k than a female with the same level of education, age, etc.\"). In Bayesian statistics, this interval estimate is called *credible interval*.\n",
